### How Do You Do, Fellow Devs? 🦄

<small><em>Oh, don't mind the pizza there, but I hope you're hungry now.</em></small>

I’m a software craftsman with a strong passion for open source software and the latest technologies. I'm working as a software engineer and consultant at [**Futurice**][futu] since August 2020. You can read my thoughts in long-form from my [blog][blog], [DEV.to][dev], or in bytesize format from [Mastodon][mt].
